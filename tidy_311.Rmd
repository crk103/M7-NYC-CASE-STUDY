## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r message=FALSE}
nyccomplaints <- read_csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/erm2-nwe9.csv?%24select=Created_Date,Agency,Complaint_Type,Incident_Address,Location")
head(nyccomplaints)
```
```{r}
summary(nyccomplaints)
```


This data is missing values
The location is all together and not seperated between longitude and latitude

# tidying messy data
```{r}
nyccomplaints %>%
  separate(Location, into = c("Point", "Longitude", "Latitude"), sep = " ")
```

```{r}
```


```{r}
nyccomplaints %>%
  separate(Incident_Address, into = c("House Number", "Street Name"), sep = " ")
```

```{r}
nyccomplaints %>%
  separate(Created_Date, into = c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ")
```
